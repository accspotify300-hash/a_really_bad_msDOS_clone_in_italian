# a_really_bad_msDOS_clone_in_italian
basically? to put it simple it's a pc os but really uncomfortable, it has to run on python 

//HOW TO USE THIS STUPID WARIO THING
ok firstly, there is just this program that is called WARIOWARE.PY(1) and gioco.txt (2)
it's italian and i am not porting it to english
(1)
the whole things work by checking the rom and loading it
if it does not find a rom it blows up (just kidding, but it gives an error)
IMPLEMENTED BASE OF PROGRAMMING BUT CAN'T REALLY BE USED FOR ANYTHING COOL:
(2)
in the game.txt there will be three numbers:
put your first number (ex 1)
put your second number (ex 2)
put 10 or 20 as your third number 
if you put 10 it'll add up the first two number (ex: 1+2)
if you put 20 it'll multiply the first two numebrs (ex:1X2)
I AM NOT IMPLEMENTING MORE, DO WHATEVER YA WANT WITH IT
JUST KNOW IT HAS 7000 BYTES OF RAM OR ROM
